# Chainlink Spring Hackathon 2023

## NFT Rent Marketplace
### Overview
The NFT Rent Marketplace is a unique project that leverages the power of Ethereum's ERC721 standard to create a marketplace where users can rent Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This project showcases how NFTs can be utilized beyond buying and selling, opening up a new realm of possibilities for NFT use-cases.

### How It Works
The NFT Rent Marketplace contract inherits from the ERC721 standard and introduces additional structures and functionalities to support the renting of NFTs.
The project integrates Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF), Chainlink Functions, and Space & Time (SxT) to bring added value, flexibility, efficiency, and scalability to the system.
